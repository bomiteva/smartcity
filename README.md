# Gamified historical walks

## Outline
Gamify the visit of historical places - achievements for visiting all of the historical places in one area or all of the historical places of one category in a given area, e.g. all monuments or all cathedrals, etc.

## Benefits
Introducing gamification in the tourism could make (hook) people to walk around more (be more active) and at the same time - visit more of the local "attractions" (historical places). This would be beneficial for tourism as more people would like to visit more places.

## Other 
 - May include VR/AR to present more information about a particular place/facility.
 - Rating for visitors, e.g. "4th level tourist"

## Gamebook/story
 - It guides you through the city - to visit a sequence of locations that would tell the story of an era (age), area or person.

## Children
 - Have an additional small animal figurine near the basic monument/location that woudl be fun for kids. It could be "checked in" in the application and marked as visited/seen by the kid.

## TODO/Problems
 - Find the locations of the monuments - data from the government?
 
# Previous ideas
 - Google maps reviews of playgrounds - use gamification to motivate people to visit their local ones
  - Cons:
    - No improvements over Google Maps
  - Pros:
    - Added value / fun element (gamification) - does your neightborhood has better reviews?
